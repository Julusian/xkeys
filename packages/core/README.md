# X-keys - Core

This folder contains the platform-agnostic parts of the X-keys library.

*You should not be importing this package directly, instead you will want to do so via one of the wrapper libraries to provide the appropriate HID bindings for your target platform, see [https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/xkeys](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/xkeys)*
